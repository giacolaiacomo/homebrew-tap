  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Start Glancy now and at every login:
        brew services start glancy
      Every permission is optional; the first launch shows a checklist in the notch.
      For the Claude Code agents, add the hook described in the README:
        https://github.com/giacolaiacomo/glancy#claude-code-setup
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # Headless: every module on throwaway state, no window, no permission prompt. Run from inside
    # the bundle so the bundled now-playing helper and icon are checked too.
    system prefix/"Glancy.app/Contents/MacOS/Glancy", "--self-test"
